This is my first post on my blog! 

The Gatsby template name was "Hello World". However unoriginal it may seem, I still think nothing says I barely know how I've got here, and I've arrived quite like it. 
A year ago, I was mildly impressed when my python3 installation printed "Hello World!".

Capitals. 

Exclamation point. 

A single line of code. 

I've repeated "Hello World" in static HTML, in bold red CSS3 font, in Console.log()'s, plain javascript, React, Markdown, git, mangoDB stored strings, POSTGRES, Node.js..... 

Still holding an optimistic yet uneasy feeling that they might all be possibly meaningless and at the same time completely necessary.

And now finally in a Gatsby "Blog Template". That I eventually hope will not be recognized as such.  

Till the Next...
